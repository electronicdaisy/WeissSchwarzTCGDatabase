# Weiß Schwarz TCG Database

This script is based on [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/). It iterates over the english version of the official
[Weiß Schwarz card list](http://ws-tcg.com/en/cardlist/list/) and stores the information about each card in a sqlite3
database. The images for each card are stored in a separate folder.

Later on, it will be possible to store the information in an Excel or a PDF file and I will provide the files. So you
do not have to run the script.

### TODO

* write the INSTALL section
* support storing the information in an Excel or a PDF file
* customize the script with settings
* upload the files
